# global-events

Global node's events library in distributed system via redis pub/sub mechanism

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rain1017/global-events.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rain1017/global-events)
[![Dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/rain1017/global-events.svg)](https://david-dm.org/rain1017/global-events)

API is compatible with Node's builtin [events library](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html) except the following exception:
All listener operations are local (In fact you are calling built-in events library), so you can't remove a remote listener, or get global listener counts. Do not make any assumption on api order in a distributed system (We can't guarantee a listener can get called right after addListener)

## Quick Start

```
var redis = require('redis');
var publishClient = redis.createClient();
var subscribeClient = redis.createClient();
var events = require('global-events');

//pub: redis client for publish events
//sub: redis client for subscribe events (should use the same db as pub)
//You can left pub/sub to null as long as you don't fire event or add listeners
//
//prefix(Optional): redis pub/sub channel prefix
var emitter = new events.EventEmitter({
									pub: publishClient, 
									sub: subscribeClient, 
									prefix: 'prefix'
									});

emitter.on('event', function(arg1, arg2 ...){});

//WARN: In fact the event subscription can't take effect immediately, delay some time before emit if you wish to see listener really get called
emitter.emit('event', arg1, arg2 ...); //args should be JSON serializeble

//close redis connection (optional)
emitter.end();

```
